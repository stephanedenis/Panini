    "abstract": "The problem of data contamination is now almost inevitable during the\ndevelopment of large language models (LLMs), with the training data commonly\nintegrating those evaluation benchmarks even unintentionally. This problem\nsubsequently makes it hard to benchmark LLMs fairly. Instead of constructing\ncontamination-free datasets (quite hard), we propose a novel framework,\n\\textbf{LNE-Blocking}, to restore model performance prior to contamination on\npotentially leaked datasets. Our framework consists of two components:\ncontamination detection and disruption operation. For the prompt, the framework\nfirst uses the contamination detection method, \\textbf{LNE}, to assess the\nextent of contamination in the model. Based on this, it adjusts the intensity\nof the disruption operation, \\textbf{Blocking}, to elicit non-memorized\nresponses from the model. Our framework is the first to efficiently restore the\nmodel's greedy decoding performance. This comes with a strong performance on\nmultiple datasets with potential leakage risks, and it consistently achieves\nstable recovery results across different models and varying levels of data\ncontamination. We release the code at https://github.com/RuijieH/LNE-Blocking\nto facilitate research.",

    "title": "Assessing Historical Structural Oppression Worldwide via Rule-Guided\n  Prompting of Large Language Models",
    "abstract": "Traditional efforts to measure historical structural oppression struggle with\ncross-national validity due to the unique, locally specified histories of\nexclusion, colonization, and social status in each country, and often have\nrelied on structured indices that privilege material resources while\noverlooking lived, identity-based exclusion. We introduce a novel framework for\noppression measurement that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate\ncontext-sensitive scores of lived historical disadvantage across diverse\ngeopolitical settings. Using unstructured self-identified ethnicity utterances\nfrom a multilingual COVID-19 global study, we design rule-guided prompting\nstrategies that encourage models to produce interpretable, theoretically\ngrounded estimations of oppression. We systematically evaluate these strategies\nacross multiple state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results demonstrate that LLMs, when\nguided by explicit rules, can capture nuanced forms of identity-based\nhistorical oppression within nations. This approach provides a complementary\nmeasurement tool that highlights dimensions of systemic exclusion, offering a\nscalable, cross-cultural lens for understanding how oppression manifests in\ndata-driven research and public health contexts. To support reproducible\nevaluation, we release an open-sourced benchmark dataset for assessing LLMs on\noppression measurement\n(https://github.com/chattergpt/llm-oppression-benchmark).",

    "abstract": "Slide decks, serving as digital reports that bridge the gap between\npresentation slides and written documents, are a prevalent medium for conveying\ninformation in both academic and corporate settings. Their multimodal nature,\ncombining text, images, and charts, presents challenges for retrieval-augmented\ngeneration systems, where the quality of retrieval directly impacts downstream\nperformance. Traditional approaches to slide retrieval often involve separate\nindexing of modalities, which can increase complexity and lose contextual\ninformation. This paper investigates various methodologies for effective slide\nretrieval, including visual late-interaction embedding models like ColPali, the\nuse of visual rerankers, and hybrid retrieval techniques that combine dense\nretrieval with BM25, further enhanced by textual rerankers and fusion methods\nlike Reciprocal Rank Fusion. A novel Vision-Language Models-based captioning\npipeline is also evaluated, demonstrating significantly reduced embedding\nstorage requirements compared to visual late-interaction techniques, alongside\ncomparable retrieval performance. Our analysis extends to the practical aspects\nof these methods, evaluating their runtime performance and storage demands\nalongside retrieval efficacy, thus offering practical guidance for the\nselection and development of efficient and robust slide retrieval systems for\nreal-world applications.",

    "abstract": "High memory demands of generative language models have drawn attention to\nquantization, which reduces computational cost, memory usage, and latency by\nmapping model weights to lower-precision integers. Approaches such as GPTQ\neffectively minimize input-weight product errors during quantization; however,\nrecent empirical studies show that they can increase biased outputs and degrade\nperformance on fairness benchmarks, and it remains unclear which specific\nweights cause this issue. In this work, we draw new links between quantization\nand model fairness by adding explicit group-fairness constraints to the\nquantization objective and introduce Fair-GPTQ, the first quantization method\nexplicitly designed to reduce unfairness in large language models. The added\nconstraints guide the learning of the rounding operation toward less-biased\ntext generation for protected groups. Specifically, we focus on stereotype\ngeneration involving occupational bias and discriminatory language spanning\ngender, race, and religion. Fair-GPTQ has minimal impact on performance,\npreserving at least 90% of baseline accuracy on zero-shot benchmarks, reduces\nunfairness relative to a half-precision model, and retains the memory and speed\nbenefits of 4-bit quantization. We also compare the performance of Fair-GPTQ\nwith existing debiasing methods and find that it achieves performance on par\nwith the iterative null-space projection debiasing approach on\nracial-stereotype benchmarks. Overall, the results validate our theoretical\nsolution to the quantization problem with a group-bias term, highlight its\napplicability for reducing group bias at quantization time in generative\nmodels, and demonstrate that our approach can further be used to analyze\nchannel- and weight-level contributions to fairness during quantization.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained with reinforcement\nlearning from verifiable rewards (RLVR), yet real-world deployment demands\nmodels that can self-improve without labels or external judges. Existing\nlabel-free methods, confidence minimization, self-consistency, or majority-vote\nobjectives, stabilize learning but steadily shrink exploration, causing an\nentropy collapse: generations become shorter, less diverse, and brittle. Unlike\nprior approaches such as Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (TTRL), which\nprimarily adapt models to the immediate unlabeled dataset at hand, our goal is\nbroader: to enable general improvements without sacrificing the model's\ninherent exploration capacity and generalization ability, i.e., evolving. We\nformalize this issue and propose EVolution-Oriented and Label-free\nReinforcement Learning (EVOL-RL), a simple rule that couples stability with\nvariation under a label-free setting. EVOL-RL keeps the majority-voted answer\nas a stable anchor (selection) while adding a novelty-aware reward that favors\nresponses whose reasoning differs from what has already been produced\n(variation), measured in semantic space. Implemented with GRPO, EVOL-RL also\nuses asymmetric clipping to preserve strong signals and an entropy regularizer\nto sustain search. This majority-for-selection + novelty-for-variation design\nprevents collapse, maintains longer and more informative chains of thought, and\nimproves both pass@1 and pass@n.

However, this reliance introduces new attack surfaces within\nthe retrieval pipeline, beyond the LLM itself. While prior RAG attacks have\nexposed such vulnerabilities, they largely rely on manipulating user queries,\nwhich is often infeasible in practice due to fixed or protected user inputs.\nThis narrow focus overlooks a more realistic and stealthy vector: instructional\nprompts, which are widely reused, publicly shared, and rarely audited. Their\nimplicit trust makes them a compelling target for adversaries to manipulate RAG\nbehavior covertly.\n  We introduce a novel attack for Adversarial Instructional Prompt (AIP) that\nexploits adversarial instructional prompts to manipulate RAG outputs by subtly\naltering retrieval behavior. By shifting the attack surface to the\ninstructional prompts, AIP reveals how trusted yet seemingly benign interface\ncomponents can be weaponized to degrade system integrity.

Existing\nstudies primarily formulate OpenRE as a clustering task.

However, their reliance on human\nannotation limits their practicality. In this paper, we propose an OpenRE\nframework based on large language models (LLMs), which directly predicts new\nrelations for test instances by leveraging their strong language understanding\nand generation abilities, without human intervention. Specifically, our\nframework consists of two core components: (1) a relation discoverer (RD),\ndesigned to predict new relations for test instances based on\n\\textit{demonstrations} formed by training instances with known relations; and\n(2) a relation predictor (RP), used to select the most likely relation for a\ntest instance from $n$ candidate relations, guided by \\textit{demonstrations}\ncomposed of their instances. To enhance the ability of our framework to predict\nnew relations, we design a self-correcting inference strategy composed of three\nstages: relation discovery, relation denoising, and relation prediction. In the\nfirst stage, we use RD to preliminarily predict new relations for all test\ninstances. Next, we apply RP to select some high-reliability test instances for\neach new relation from the prediction results of RD through a cross-validation\nmethod.

Prior approaches predominantly rely on query-key attention\nscores to rank and evict cached tokens, assuming that attention intensity\ncorrelates with semantic importance. However, this heuristic overlooks the\ncontribution of value vectors, which directly influence the attention output.\nIn this paper, we propose CurDKV, a novel, value-centric KV compression method\nthat selects keys and values based on leverage scores computed from CUR matrix\ndecomposition. Our approach approximates the dominant subspace of the attention\noutput $softmax(QK^T)V$, ensuring that the retained tokens best preserve the\nmodel's predictive behavior. Theoretically, we show that attention score\napproximation does not guarantee output preservation, and demonstrate that\nCUR-based selection minimizes end-to-end attention reconstruction loss.\nEmpirically, CurDKV achieves up to 9.6% higher accuracy than state-of-the-art\nmethods like SnapKV and ChunkKV under aggressive compression budgets on LLaMA\nand Mistral, while maintaining compatibility with FlashAttention and Grouped\nQuery Attention.

This research addresses these gaps\nthrough rigorous experimental design using balanced Persian datasets containing\n900 texts for sentiment analysis (positive, negative, neutral) and 1,800 texts\nfor emotion detection (anger, fear, happiness, hate, sadness, surprise). The\nmain focus was to allow for a direct and fair comparison among different\nmodels, by using consistent prompts, uniform processing parameters, and by\nanalyzing the performance metrics such as precision, recall, F1-scores, along\nwith misclassification patterns.

    "abstract": "We introduce LITcoder, an open-source library for building and benchmarking\nneural encoding models. Designed as a flexible backend, LITcoder provides\nstandardized tools for aligning continuous stimuli (e.g., text and speech) with\nbrain data, transforming stimuli into representational features, mapping those\nfeatures onto brain data, and evaluating the predictive performance of the\nresulting model on held-out data. The library implements a modular pipeline\ncovering a wide array of methodological design choices, so researchers can\neasily compose, compare, and extend encoding models without reinventing core\ninfrastructure. Such choices include brain datasets, brain regions, stimulus\nfeature (both neural-net-based and control, such as word rate), downsampling\napproaches, and many others. In addition, the library provides built-in\nlogging, plotting, and seamless integration with experiment tracking platforms\nsuch as Weights & Biases (W&B). We demonstrate the scalability and versatility\nof our framework by fitting a range of encoding models to three story listening\ndatasets: LeBel et al. (2023), Narratives, and Little Prince. We also explore\nthe methodological choices critical for building encoding models for continuous\nfMRI data, illustrating the importance of accounting for all tokens in a TR\nscan (as opposed to just taking the last one, even when contextualized),\nincorporating hemodynamic lag effects, using train-test splits that minimize\ninformation leakage, and accounting for head motion effects on encoding model\npredictivity. Overall, LITcoder lowers technical barriers to encoding model\nimplementation, facilitates systematic comparisons across models and datasets,\nfosters methodological rigor, and accelerates the development of high-quality\nhigh-performance predictive models of brain activity.\n  Project page: https://litcoder-brain.github.io",

    "abstract": "Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common brain disorder in\nchildren that can persist into adulthood, affecting social, academic, and\ncareer life. Early diagnosis is crucial for managing these impacts on patients\nand the healthcare system but is often labor-intensive and time-consuming. This\npaper presents a novel method to improve ADHD diagnosis precision and\ntimeliness by leveraging Deep Learning (DL) approaches and electroencephalogram\n(EEG) signals. We introduce ADHDeepNet, a DL model that utilizes comprehensive\ntemporal-spatial characterization, attention modules, and explainability\ntechniques optimized for EEG signals. ADHDeepNet integrates feature extraction\nand refinement processes to enhance ADHD diagnosis. The model was trained and\nvalidated on a dataset of 121 participants (61 ADHD, 60 Healthy Controls),\nemploying nested cross-validation for robust performance. The proposed\ntwo-stage methodology uses a 10-fold cross-subject validation strategy.\nInitially, each iteration optimizes the model's hyper-parameters with inner\n2-fold cross-validation. Then, Additive Gaussian Noise (AGN) with various\nstandard deviations and magnification levels is applied for data augmentation.\nADHDeepNet achieved 100% sensitivity and 99.17% accuracy in classifying ADHD/HC\nsubjects. To clarify model explainability and identify key brain regions and\nfrequency bands for ADHD diagnosis, we analyzed the learned weights and\nactivation patterns of the model's primary layers.

We extend the PoPStat framework,\noriginally devised to link entire population pyramids with cause-specific\nmortality by applying it to COVID-19. Using 2019 United Nations World\nPopulation Prospects age-sex distributions together with cumulative cases and\ndeaths per million recorded up to 5 May 2023 by Our World in Data, we calculate\nPoPDivergence (the Kullback-Leibler divergence from an optimised reference\npyramid) for 180+ countries and derive PoPStat-COVID19 as the Pearson\ncorrelation between that divergence and log-transformed incidence or mortality.\nOptimisation selects Malta's old-skewed pyramid as the reference, yielding\nstrong negative correlations for cases (r=-0.86, p<0.001, R^2=0.74) and deaths\n(r=-0.82, p<0.001, R^2=0.67).

    "abstract": "Existing approaches to sample size calculations for developing clinical\nprediction models have focused on ensuring that the expected value of a chosen\nperformance measure meets a pre-specified target. For example, to limit\nmodel-overfitting, the sample size is commonly chosen such that the expected\ncalibration slope (CS) is 0.9, close to 1 for a perfectly calibrated model. In\npractice, due to sampling variability, model performance can vary considerably\nacross different development samples of the recommended size. If this\nvariability is high, the probability of obtaining a model with performance\nclose to the target for a given measure may be unacceptably low. To address\nthis, we propose an adapted approach to sample size calculations that\nexplicitly incorporates performance variability by targeting the probability of\nacceptable performance (PrAP). For example, in the context of calibration, we\nmay define a model as acceptably calibrated if CS falls in a pre-defined range,\ne.g. between 0.85 and 1.15. Then we choose the required sample size to ensure\nthat PrAP(CS)=80%. For binary outcomes we implemented our approach for CS\nwithin a simulation-based framework via the R package `samplesizedev'.\nAdditionally, for CS specifically, we have proposed an equivalent analytical\ncalculation which is computationally efficient. While we focused on CS, the\nsimulation-based framework is flexible and can be easily extended to\naccommodate other performance measures and types of outcomes. When adhering to\nexisting recommendations, we found that performance variability increased\nsubstantially as the number of predictors, p, decreased. Consequently, PrAP(CS)\nwas often low. For example, with 5 predictors, PrAP(CS) was around 50%. Our\nadapted approach resulted in considerably larger sample sizes, especially for\np<10. Applying shrinkage tends to improve PrAP(CS).",

D’après de nombreuses études, il est à l’origine des mécanismes d’acquisition du langage chez l’enfant. Mais qu’en est-il lorsque l’on né sourd ? Ce mémoire explore la question de l’acquisition du langage chez l’enfant né sourd profond ayant reçu un implant cochléaire. En établissant tout d’abord les bases de l’acquisition du langage chez l’enfant entendant, on pourra ensuite mener une réflexion sur le développement cognitif lié au langage et quelles stratégies d’adaptation sont développées chez l’enfant sourd implanté pour acquérir l’oralité. L’implant cochléaire permet-il à l’enfant atteint de surdité profonde d’acquérir l’oralité, et à quel niveau ?",

    "title": "dispositifs d'acquisition phonologique et didactique de l'oral",
    "abstract": "On oppose traditionnellement deux courants posant différentes hypothèses sur les dispositifs en lien avec l'acquisition du langage. Le premier, de nature générativiste, postule un instinct du langage (Pinker, 2000). Dans ce cadre, l'enfant apprendrait à parler comme l'araignée tisse sa toile, sans apport réel d'autrui et sans une construction consciente nourrie de l'input (familial ou scolaire). Le second courant, pose l'acquisition comme émergente à partir de l'influence de l'input, aidant à mémoriser et stocker des éléments concrets du langage, puis à construire, à partir de capacités cognitives particulières, des dispositifs généraux et réguliers de la langue (morpho-phonologiques, morpho-syntaxiques, syntaxiques...). Notre recherche est fondée sur le second courant. Nous envisageons le développement phonologique de l'enfant comme émergent à partir de deux types de processus fondant l'acquisition du langage. D'une part, avec la fréquence des \" morceaux \" ou \" chunks \" du langage reçu à travers l'input et mémorisé par l'enfant. D'autre part, en se basant sur la capacité à construire, à travers les régularités statistiques offertes par l'input et gardées en mémoire, des formes de généralisations qui permettraient d'apprendre les schémas les plus généraux de la langue.",

La question du babillage est une question récurrente dans tous les travaux portant sur l'acquisition d'une langue des signes. Le babillage manuel représente les prémices d'une communication gestuelle qui se développera par la suite avec les premiers signes linguistiques puis les combinaisons des signes. Tout comme pour l'enfant entendant, certaines formes linguistiques en langue des signes sont acquises relativement tôt alors que d'autres le sont tardivement. Ces études sur l'acquisition d'une langue des signes ont permis d'affirmer que l'enfant sourd, par le biais de sa langue des signes, était un être communiquant, un être de paroles.",

    "title": "Je comme un Autre dans des dialogues adulte-enfant",
    "abstract": "Selon Elizabeth Bates, la grammaire des langues naturelles est tellement imprégnée de référence à la personne que leur acquisition requière une conscience de soi. Ceci implique que l’on pourrait utiliser nos observations sur l’acquisition des marques de personne pour comprendre l’émergence de la conscience de soi chez l’enfant (Bates 1990 : 165). Or, nous pouvons constater que les enfants francophones entre un an et demi et trois ans, n’emploient pas uniquement les formes adultes je et moi je en position sujet dans les énoncés utilisés pour référer à eux-mêmes. On trouve également des voyelles préverbales, et des prédications sans sujets explicites, leur prénom, le pronom de deuxième personne, de troisième personne et le pronom objet (moi). Cet usage de formes non standard fait partie d’un cheminement particulier qui permet à l’enfant de s’approprier le système de références personnelles de la langue adulte. L’enfant fait alors preuve de créativité et associe à chaque forme, une fonction particulière en contexte (Budwig 1995 ; Morgenstern 2006). Cependant, même si l’enfant a des capacités d’ordre biologique et cognitif innées, et manifeste toute sa créativité linguistique au quotidien, il doit apprendre les conventions linguistiques à partir du langage des autres. Il les construit en parallèle avec les autres apprentissages d’ordre cognitif et social comme le fait de pouvoir suivre le regard de l’autre, d’attirer son attention, de lire ses intentions, la capacité à faire des analogies, à catégoriser, à symboliser. Au niveau linguistique, selon l’approche cognitive et constructiviste, l’enfant apprend des mots et des constructions isolées (Tomasello 2003), et ce sont ces petits bouts de langage doués de sens en contexte qui petit à petit lui permettent de se construire des grammaires successives transitoires (Cohen 1924). La langue se fabrique entre autres dans le cours des interactions constantes entre l’enfant et ses interlocuteurs adultes. Pour retrouver les traces de ce que les enfants empruntent, ou des éléments à porter au compte de leur créativité propre, il est donc particulièrement intéressant de se pencher sur le rôle du langage adressé et du langage entendu dans l’appropriation des constructions langagières qui permettent à l’enfant de marquer son positionnement co-énonciatif et sa subjectivité. Après avoir fait un état des lieux sur les formes de référence à soi en position sujet dans le langage de l’enfant, nous étudierons les écarts que permettent les substitutions pronominales produites par l’enfant et chercherons à saisir, à partir de quelques extraits, le rôle du langage qui lui est adressé. L’analyse de quelques séquences en contexte mettra en valeur les représentations de soi et du langage que peut construire un enfant dans le temps.",

    "title": "Acquérir le langage dans sa dimension multimodale : verbal, intonation et posturo-mimo-gestualité dans le développement normal et le développement autistique",
    "abstract": "Pour comprendre le processus d'acquisition du langage chez le jeune enfant, il faut envisager le langage humain dans sa dimension multimodale : le locuteur combine des phonèmes pour former des mots et des mots pour former des phrases, mais il doit également articuler ses verbalisations avec la prosodie de sa langue, avec des paramètres posturo-mimo-gestuels, et surtout (et avant tout), il doit adapter son langage à la situation et s'articuler avec l'autre, son partenaire dans l'interaction.Le nouveau-né est exposé dès sa naissance (et même avant, in utero) au langage et manifeste très tôt des aptitudes à la communication, à l'interaction avec son entourage (Boysson-Bardies, 1996). Les différents paramètres constitutifs du langage vont se structurer progressivement : le nourrisson va d'abord intégrer les règles de l'interaction, puis va entrer dans le langage par la prosodie et le geste, pour accéder enfin au langage articulé.L'articulation entre ces différents niveaux est progressive et le processus d'acquisition se caractérise par un va-et-vient entre structuration « mécanique » du langage, mise en place d'un « moule », d'un « format » (interaction et prosodie), et structuration « linguistique » (phonologie, morphosyntaxe, sémantique, pragmatique), les différents acquis s'intégrant dans des formats de plus en plus complexes.Cette capacité d'articulation, à l'intérieur des différentes modalités constitutives du langage, entre les différentes modalités, et avec autrui, est au cœur du processus d'acquisition. Il arrive toutefois que des enfants présentent des dysfonctionnements dans le développement (voire une absence de développement) du langage, comme c'est le cas dans l'autisme, et n'accèdent pas aux combinaisons morphosyntaxiques. Cependant, certains d'entre eux semblent mettre en place les différents paramètres constitutifs du langage au cours de leur première année (Sheinkopf et al., 2000).Nous tenterons d'illustrer les différences entre développement normal et développement autistique et de cerner les limites du développement langagier de l'enfant autiste, en observant les étapes de la construction du langage et particulièrement l'articulation des différents paramètres qui le constituent (vocalisations, verbalisations, prosodie, mimo-gestualité...). En nous appuyant sur des études longitudinales d'enfants tout venant et d'une enfant autiste entre la naissance et deux ans, nous essayerons de montrer que l'âge de 18 mois semble constituer l'âge-charnière pour l'articulation des différentes modalités, à savoir la syllabation, l'intonation, les mimiques, les gestes et l'intégration des règles d'interaction, préalable nécessaire au bon fonctionnement du langage et de la communication.En effet, chez l'enfant autiste, même si on constate souvent un développement plus ou moins conforme avant 18 mois, les dysfonctionnements communicatifs et langagiers deviennent souvent saillants à cet âge (Baron-Cohen et al., 1992 ; Maestro et Muratori, 2005). Ils peuvent être reliés aux difficultés d'articulation des différentes modalités constitutives du langage, qui représenteraient pour ces enfants une charge cognitive trop importante. Par exemple, une mise en conformité de la syllabation s'accompagnera d'une atypie de la prosodie, et inversement, une prosodie conforme s'accompagnera de productions comportant des syllabes non canoniques. Les difficultés d'articulation de l'enfant autiste se situent également au niveau du pointage. En effet, dans le cas où il apparaît, il diffère qualitativement de celui de l'enfant tout-venant : l'enfant autiste est incapable, notamment, d'articuler les différents paramètres qui accompagnent le geste (regard sur l'objet, regard sur l'adulte et vocalisation) de façon simultanée. Nous illustrerons ce point grâce à des comparaisons de pointages d'un enfant autiste et d'enfants tout-venant à 15 mois.",

    "title": "Acquisition et didactique des langues : articulations, appropriation et dynamiques",
    "abstract": "Le premier chapitre, intitulé Itinéraire et cadre de recherche pour une articulation de l’acquisition et de la didactique des langues – une seconde introduction s’articule de manière chronologique. L’objectif est ici de montrer comment la réflexion générale a été nourrie par une expérience professionnelle diversifiée. Ainsi, les premiers résultats sur les variations articulatoires constatées dans la parole de jeunes enfants présentés dans le doctorat posent les questions du rôle et du statut de ces variations et leur place dans le développement de l’oral. Le terrain scolaire s’inscrit donc comme une suite logique pour poursuivre la réflexion. Les différentes expériences et pratiques de classe ne cesseront dès lors de s’articuler avec des conceptions plus théoriques à propos du développement de l’oral chez le jeune enfant (2-6 ans). Le chapitre 2 (Acquisition, dynamiques et structuration des langues et du langage) revient sur la dimension épistémologique de l’acquisition du langage. Les différentes méthodologies utilisées ainsi que la question toujours brûlante de l’échantillonnage des corpus de parole d’enfant interrogent l’acquisition comme objet de recherche, et de fait le chercheur, sa posture et ses choix. La principale difficulté en acquisition est de comprendre comment les enfants apprennent à parler, et non seulement comment ils parlent. Ainsi, les théories dites du chaos et de la complexité permettent d’envisager sous un angle nouveau le développement langagier, jusqu’à redéfinir l’objet de recherche. Au-delà de la parole effective et observable, il s’agit d’opérer une recentration particulière sur les dynamiques de l’évolution de la parole chez les enfants en en étudiant les caractères linguistiques. Cette posture s’inscrit donc dans une vision dynamique et structurée du développement linguistique, permettant de mieux comprendre les caractéristiques non-linéaires de l’évolution psycholinguistique de l’enfant. Dans le chapitre 3 (Acquisition et didactique du Français Langue Maternelle (FLM)), il est tout d’abord question de revenir sur les dimensions pédagogiques et didactique de l’oral à l’école maternelle avant relier les travaux en acquisition à propos de l’émergence et du développement de la conscience phonologique chez l’enfant, et l’accompagnement stimulé de cette conscience dans un objectif de préparation à l’entrée dans la littéracie. Ainsi, en étudiant les processus psycho-sociaux à l’œuvre dans l’acquisition du langage, il devient possible de s’appuyer sur ceux-ci pour mieux appréhender l’enseignement de l’oral à l’école. De même, en donnant une signification aux variations phonético-phonologiques qui caractérise la parole de l’enfant, il devient possible de prendre en compte l’identité complexe de l’élève (également enfant), c’est-à-dire une personne sociale en construction. Dans la même optique, le chapitre 4 (Acquisition et didactique du Français Langue Etrangère et Seconde (FLE et FLS)), propose de partir des questions d’enseignement pour mieux s’interroger sur les questions d’apprentissage de langues. On vise ici à expliciter l’importance de considérer la didactique des langues selon un continuum (maternelle, seconde, étrangère) d’une part, de la situer dans une perspective ‘acquisitionniste’ d’autre part. En effet, la complexité des processus en acquisition du langage ajoutée à celle de la didactique de la langue maternelle invite à aborder l’enseignement des langues seconde ou étrangère avec précaution. La perspective théorique (Interactionnisme socio-discursif) dans lequel s’inscrit l’ensemble des travaux du dossier se rapproche alors et justifie pleinement les démarches communicatives et actionnelles développées en didactique du FLES. Enfin, dans un chapitre 5 conclusif (Complexité, acquisition et didactique. Bilans et perspectives), il est question de dresser un bilan de l’ensemble de cette réflexion. Il s’agit de revenir notamment sur l’importance de redéfinir un objet d’étude (l’acquisition) grâce à de nouvelles approches (théories du chaos et de la complexité), tout en s’inscrivant dans une historicité disciplinaire importante. Pour préciser les liens existant entre acquisition et didactique des langues, le mémoire de synthèse se termine sur la constitution de programmes de recherche pour le futur.",

Il a aussi pour objectif de comparer le discours parental et enfantin pour observer l’influence de l’input sur l’acquisition de la variable phonologique. Les analyses révèlent que l’évolution de l’acquisition de la variable phonologique serait influencée par le langage auquel les enfants sont exposés. Par ailleurs, les parents semblent ajuster leurs discours en fonction du développement linguistique de leur enfant et tendent à élider davantage le schwa en direction d’enfants maîtrisant cette variation. De plus, l’élision du schwa dans les énoncés adressés à l’enfant semblent conditionnée par le contexte syntaxique, comme nous l’observons avec le monosyllabique « le ». En effet, alors que l’élision est très fréquente en contexte verbal (« le » pronom), le schwa est beaucoup plus souvent maintenu en contexte nominal (« le » article). Ces données pourraient révéler une stratégie mise en place par les parents dans le but de faciliter l’acquisition du vocabulaire par l’enfant.",

    "abstract": "L'étude des processus d'acquisition et du fonctionnement du langage est un domaine de choix pour cerner les contributions de l'inter et de l'intrasubjectif ainsi que la complexité et la fécondité de leurs interrelations. D'une part, le langage, étant un objet de connaissance social par nature, arbitraire et conventionnel, ne peut s'acquérir qu'à travers l'intersubjectivité : c'est à travers le langage d'autrui, à travers les échanges qui se déroulent dans l'interaction avec autrui, que l'enfant est confronté aux propriétés de l'objet langagier aussi bien dans sa structure (signification, lexique et grammaire), que dans ses fonctions communicatives (la pragmatique). De ce point de vue, on peut supposer que différentes stratégies employées par l'adulte dans son interaction avec l'enfant sont susceptibles de susciter du progrès. D'autre part, s'agissant de l'acquisition stable et autonome de connaissances nouvelles, à chaque moment, l'influence des expériences intersubectives ne peut se comprendre qu'en relation avec l'intrasubjectif, c'est à dire, en rapport avec la manière qu'a l'enfant d'agir en retour, du type de traitement que l'enfant peut faire de ses expériences intersubjectives, ainsi qu'avec l'état de connaissance que l'enfant a d'autres aspects du langage et de son niveau de développement plus général.",

    "title": "Les facettes de l'interprétation en acquisition du langage",
    "abstract": "La question de l’interprétation est rarement évoquée dans les études en acquisition du langage, et pourtant, elle est au cœur du processus d’acquisition ainsi que de l’activité même du chercheur. L’acquisition de la langue maternelle a souvent été décrite comme une série de processus formels d’émergence ou de construction des systèmes formels de la langue (phonologie, grammaire, syntaxe). Mais ce type d’approche se heurte tôt ou tard à la question du sens. Comment les bébés/jeunes enfants s’approprient-ils le sens des mots, des constructions, de la grammaire ? Le sens ne constitue pas l’étape finale dans un processus qui irait des plus petites unités jusqu’au discours. Sans nier le rôle des mécanismes cognitifs, perceptifs ou mémoriels, on peut penser au contraire que l’enfant va du sens aux formes (Bruner, 1983, 1987; Nelson, 2007; Tomasello, 2004; Vygotski, 2002) : des premières expériences sensorielles en tant que nourrisson à ses échanges langagiers, l’enfant se trouve inscrit dans des contextes qui font sens. Et ces contextes (récurrents, voire ritualisés, ce que Bruner appelle des formats) lui fournissent les éléments pour donner sens à son tour à toute expérience nouvelle et en particulier aux mots et discours qui lui sont adressés. Autant dire que cette activité, fondamentalement interprétative constitue un des mécanismes de base de l’acquisition du langage. L’enfant n’est pas seul dans ce processus. Les formats sont des contextes socialement partagés et le lieu de la construction d’un sens intersubjectif. Dès sa naissance (voire avant), le nourrisson est plongé dans un univers communicatif dans lequel les adultes donnent sens à ses mimiques, à ses mouvements, à ses gazouillis et à ses pleurs … cette activité interprétative de l’adulte alimente à son tour le contexte dans lequel le bébé est inscrit, lui renvoyant du sens en miroir … Tout au long de la première enfance les adultes vont doubler leur participation aux échanges d’une activité interprétative sous-jacente (donnant sens à ce qui ne s’exprime pas par un code intersubjectivement partagé mais entretenant et développant l’intersubjectivité ) et/ou ouverte (explicitant, reformulant et commentant les attitudes, gestes ou premiers énoncés des enfants) … Ainsi, l’adulte en interaction produit toujours des interprétations enrichies (Brown, 1973) des productions enfantines. Enfin, le chercheur en acquisition du langage, confronté aux corpus, se trouve nécessairement en position interprétative. La question de l’interprétation se pose peut-être avec encore plus d’acuité que face à des échanges entre adultes. Elle se pose dès la transcription (encodage du non verbal, transcription phonétique, choix orthographique …), la classification des formes et la glose. Même si le chercheur peut s’appuyer sur les interprétations fournies directement ou indirectement par les adultes en interaction avec les enfants, il sera dans ces tâches toujours confronté aux zones d’ombre et aux malentendus observables … Surtout, la question épistémologique se posera, au niveau de l’analyse des productions enfantines, de ce qui est attribué à l’enfant comme savoir et conscience, naviguant en permanence entre la tentation de l’adultocentrisme et celle du behaviourisme. Cette communication cherchera à mettre en regard ces différentes facettes de la question de l’interprétation en s’appuyant sur des exemples tirés de recherches récentes, autour, notamment, de l’acquisition des expressions référentielles.

    "abstract": "L'acquisition de la langue écrite chez l'enfant sourd est une question difficile qui fait débat parmi les chercheurs. Les sourds ont beaucoup de difficultés à apprendre à lire et à écrire. En effet, environ 60% à 80% des sourds ne maîtrisent pas la langue écrite. Les difficultés des sourds à l'écrit sont très variées. Cet impressionnant taux d'illettrisme est en partie dû aux méthodes éducatives prodiguées aux enfants sourds. Ces méthodes dépendent des choix faits par le gouvernement. Effectivement, comme nous l'avons constaté au cours de nos recherches, la politique éducative mise en place dans le pays définit l'éducation reçue par les enfants sourds. En France, les parents d'enfant sourd ont la liberté de choisir l'éducation qu'ils souhaitent pour leur enfant. Nous verrons que ces décisions sont déterminantes pour l'avenir langagier de l'enfant.",

    "abstract": "Cette étude décrit le processus d'acquisition de la morphosyntaxe du ISANGU (une langue bantoue du Gabon) par les enfants. Nous sommes parti du constat que l'essentiel de la théorie en psycholinguistique est basée sur les langues indo-européennes, notamment l'anglais. Ce travail sur une langue « nouvelle », avec un système morphosyntaxique très riche, est une contribution très intéressante dans le débat concernant les universaux et les spécificités linguistiques dans l'acquisition du langage par les enfants. Nous avons développé quatre aspects : l'acquisition des classes nominales, celle des extensions verbales, celle des expressions locatives et celle de la structure passive. Concernant l'acquisition des classes nominales, nous avons montré que le système des préfixes nominaux et celui des morphèmes d'accord émergent parallèlement dans le système de l'enfant, entre 20 et 48 mois. L'enfant se base sur une structure canonique CVCV du mot, qui l'amène à de nombreuses ré-analyses. Concernant l'accord du verbe, il organise le système sur la base de la distinction ANIME vs NON-ANIME. Concernant les extensions verbales, nous avons montré que leur émergence dans le système de l'enfant dépend de plusieurs facteurs, dont les plus importants sont la transparence sémantique et la productivité. Concernant les locatifs, malgré l'apparente complexité du système isangu, nos résultats sont conformes à ceux de la plupart des études précédentes, sur diverses langues. Enfin, pour la structure passive, nous avons montré qu'elle n'est pas difficile pour l'enfant. Son utilisation par l'enfant Musangu dépend de la prototypicalité de la scène et de la transitivité de l'action.",

La seconde partie, expérimentale, porte sur l’étude d’une enfant ayant subi un AVC hémorragique pariétal gauche et entrant au CP cette année. Une évaluation a été effectuée tous les trimestres grâce à des bilans orthophoniques validés. Cette recherche nous a permis de déterminer que l’AVC avait bien un impact sur l’acquisition de la lecture étant donné que des difficultés sont apparues au cours de l’année.

    "abstract": "Qu’entend-on par développement ? Améliorer les conditions de vie des populations partout dans le monde. Pour les pays les moins techniquement avancés, il s’agit de poser des actes significatifs qui contribuent durablement au bien-être des populations les plus fragiles et les plus vulnérables. Il se trouve, cependant, que dans de nombreux territoires, les actions en faveur du développement ne tiennent pas compte de la réalité linguistique du terrain. Dès lors que la langue est identifiée comme un maillon faible du développement, son traitement devient une préoccupation des spécialistes des langues et des cultures. C’est donc la volonté de réunir l’impressionnante érudition des linguistes, leurs réflexions, stratégies, théories et méthodes qui a culminé dans l’émergence de la linguistique pour le développement. Celle-ci consacre l’engagement des spécialistes des langues et des cultures à s’intéresser à un domaine, le développement, pour lequel ils ont longtemps été considérés comme des voix non autorisées. L’association de linguistique et développement, deux termes aux contenus traditionnellement éloignés les uns des autres, est une construction à la fois savante et programmatique. Elle a pour effet de démontrer que le développement nécessite des solutions linguistiques et culturelles. Linguistique engagée, linguistique d’intervention, linguistique citoyenne, linguistique humanitaire, linguistique pragmatique… la linguistique pour le développement a pour objectif de mobiliser les ressources linguistiques, anthropologiques et culturelles en vue du traitement des problématiques liées au développement économique et sociétal. Son approche est nécessairement pluridisciplinaire. Dans de nombreux contextes et afin de répondre à des besoins spécifiques, elle prend la forme d’une linguistique à visée ingénieriste dont le but final reste la capacitation des langues dans tous les domaines de la vie. La finalité de la linguistique pour le développement n’est pas de défendre les langues per se. Il est plutôt question de prendre le parti des femmes et des hommes qui, partout dans le monde, ont besoin de ces langues pour exprimer leurs besoins quotidiens, souvent vitaux. Puis de concevoir les actions pour leur permettre d’avoir voix au chapitre. Les auteurs réunis dans cet ouvrage exposent, analysent et modélisent les principes de base, les orientations, les méthodes et les axes prioritaires d’une linguistique pour le développement.",

Ainsi, quel rôle les outils technologiques, qui permettent désormais de mettre en relation plusieurs interactants à distance et offrent plusieurs modes de communication dite « médiatisée », peuvent-ils jouer dans le développement de cette compétence ? A partir d’une étude portant sur l’enseignement-apprentissage de l’anglais L2 à distance, nous explorons les affordances de trois modes de communication médiatisée par ordinateur (CMO) – visioconférence, clavardage, forum électronique – pour le développement de la compétence interactionnelle.

    "abstract": "La présente étude nous a permis d’examiner le développement du vocabulaire productif, de fluence orale et de leur interaction en contexte de séjour linguistique. L'objectif de l'étude était de découvrir comment le vocabulaire productif et la fluence orale ont changé au cours de la période du séjour linguistique et de déterminer si ces changements ont montré des trajectoires de développement parallèles qui peuvent signaler l'interaction entre les deux compétences langagières. Une méthodologie prétest-posttest a été utilisée pour étudier qualitativement les changements chez cinq apprenants intermédiaires/avancés de l'anglais, qui ont passé une année universitaire dans un pays anglophone. Pour universitaire sur la fluence orale, les entretiens ont été menés avant et après l'expérience en contexte de séjour linguistique et analysés en termes de la fluence. De même, un test Lex30 a été réalisé avant et après l'expérience en contexte de séjour linguistique afin d'analyser le vocabulaire productif. Les résultats ont montré que la fluence orale s'est développée de manière significative au cours de la période de séjour linguistique, alors que le développement du vocabulaire productif était moins évident. Enfin, en raison des différences dans les résultats, l'interaction entre la fluence orale et le vocabulaire productif dans le contexte de séjour linguistique n'a pas été trouvée.",

    "abstract": "Envisager le continent africain par le prisme du concept de développement, c’est ouvrir des sentiers de réflexion autour des nouveaux enjeux liés aux politiques de développement, aux mutations économiques et culturelles et aux dynamismes identitaires issus des relations interculturelles. Ce sont là des questionnements que soulève le développement des échanges commerciaux et économiques. Des enjeux et problématiques contemporains à la place des langues dans les objectifs de développement, le chemin parcouru ici ouvre des perspectives et invite à aller de l’avant dans la réflexion et la mise en œuvre théorique et pratique. Les voix qui s’unissent dans cet ouvrage sont celles de chercheurs, penseurs, acteurs de la société civile et de politiques de développement qui confrontent leurs points de vue sur les voies du développement en Afrique. L’ensemble de la réflexion s’inscrit dans une démarche transversale et pluridisciplinaire afin que se tisse une représentation humaniste et objective de visions africaines possibles. C’est ainsi pour les auteurs, tous spécialistes reconnus de l’Afrique, l’occasion de s’interroger sur les voies qu’empruntent les nouvelles pensées, les recherches plurielles, pour favoriser la mise en œuvre de politiques de développement dans leur dynamique interculturelle, en s’affranchissant du regard de l’Autre, et donc en créant pour soi. Les contributions réunies dans cet ouvrage se penchent sur les défis contemporains auxquels le continent africain devra faire face sur la voie de son développement. Les marqueurs sont ici philosophiques, anthropologiques, culturels, juridiques, socioéconomiques. La Francophonie avec ses contours réels, la place de la langue française en Afrique subsaharienne ainsi que les apports de cette langue, désormais africaine, au développement de la sous-région, sont également abordées avec profondeur et lucidité.",

    "title": "Intégration des langues nationales dans le système éducatif et développement au Congo",
    "abstract": "Plus d’un demi-siècle après l’indépendance du Congo, les langues nationales sont toujours marginalisées et exclues de toute activité relative à la vie officielle. Le français est l’unique langue officielle du pays. Le Congo s’inscrit ainsi dans le cadre des pays africains qui pratiquent une politique linguistique d’expectative. Tout de même, le pays a toujours tenté et tente de mettre en place les politiques sociales en vue de l’amélioration des conditions de vie des citoyens. Le dernier Plan National de Développement 2018-2022 est prioritairement axé sur le renforcement de la gouvernance ; la réforme en profondeur du système éducatif et de la formation qualifiante et professionnelle ; et la diversification de l’économie. Cependant, cette réforme prônée ne fait aucunement mention de la question linguistique, quoique le système éducatif congolais soit confronté à un sérieux problème qui semble toujours être ignoré, celui de la langue française comme unique langue d’enseignement. Il a été clairement démontré, dans ce travail, que malgré le multilinguisme qui, pour certains semble être un écueil pour le développement social, à l’heure actuelle une éducation de qualité au Congo en vue du développement, passe par l’utilisation des langues nationales congolaises dans le système éducatif. Car, le développement durable est un développement inclusif, qui tient compte des réalités sociales, des pratiques langagières des populations concernées, de la diversité linguistique et culturelle. Cette étude essaie donc de présenter le rôle inéluctable des langues nationales dans le processus de développement du Congo à partir de leur intégration dans le système éducatif, les approches par excellence à adapter à la réalité congolaise parmi celles utilisées dans d’autres pays africains, ainsi que les stratégies appropriées pour la réussite d’un tel programme.",

    "abstract": "L'enfant acquiert normalement l'essentiel du système de sa langue maternelle entre un et quatre ans environ. S'appuyant sur les données fournies par la psychologie et la neuropsychologie développementales, la modélisation et la linguistique fonctionnelle, les approches fonctionnalistes développées en psycholinguistique au cours des deux dernières décennies contribuent à apporter des réponses nouvelles et documentées à la question de la constitution du système linguistique chez l'enfant. Dans ce chapitre, nous présentons d'abord les principaux fondements et enjeux de ces approches, illustrées notamment par les travaux de Bates et MacWhinney et, plus récemment, par les travaux menés dans le cadre des théories émergentistes et des théories \"usage-based \". Cette présentation est ensuite illustrée avec l'examen, plus détaillé et empirique, de trois thèmes, explorés dans le cadre de notre programme sur l'émergence du système linguistique chez l'enfant français. Le premier thème concerne la structuration du lexique : nous examinons comment le lexique précoce se constitue autour des classes de mots, en prêtant une attention particulière à l'analyse de la variabilité inter-individuelle et de sa signification pour le développement. Le deuxième thème concerne les processus de grammaticalisation : en prenant l'exemple de la catégorie linguistique des noms, nous examinons comment est acquise la contrainte grammaticale qui caractérise cette classe en français et recherchons les lieux d'interaction entre développement grammatical et développement lexical. Pour finir, nous tentons une incursion dans l'examen de la modélisation de l'allongement des énoncés, analyse menée dans le cadre de la théorie des systèmes dynamiques et centrée sur la question du rôle de la variabilité intra-individuelle dans le développement.",

    "abstract": "Dans une société où le bilinguisme tient une place de plus en plus importante, la France demeure un pays majoritairement monolingue. Le bilinguisme tend toutefois à se développer, notamment au travers d'écoles proposant l'enseignement précoce d'une seconde langue. En effet, ces écoles bilingues se multiplient, en particulier dans les régions possédant leur propre langue, comme la Bretagne ou le Pays Basque. Mais de nombreuses interrogations demeurent quant aux réels avantages de l'enseignement bilingue précoce sur le développement langagier de l'enfant dans sa langue maternelle.Notre étude a consisté en l'évaluation des compétences orales d'enfants de CP et CM2 scolarisés dans des classes monolingues, bilingues en immersion partielle français-breton et bilingues en immersion totale en langue bretonne. Nous avons ainsi pu montrer que le bilinguisme précoce, développé en immersion partielle, représente un avantage pour le développement langagier de l'enfant. Nous avons également pu constater que l'enseignement en immersion partielle se révèle plus avantageux pour les enfants que l'enseignement en immersion totale.Nous avons couplé cette évaluation avec un questionnaire destiné aux parents d'enfants bilingues, afin de nous rendre compte de l'impact du bilinguisme sur le quotidien des familles concernées par ce type d'enseignement. Un questionnaire a également été proposé aux enfants pour leur permettre de s'exprimer librement sur la place qu'occupe le breton dans leur quotidien et sur l'investissement qu'ils font de cette langue régionale. Les données recueillies grâce à ces questionnaires nous ont également permis d'éclaircir certains résultats de l'évaluation effectuée.",

    "abstract": "Cette recherche s’intéresse à l’acquisition du bilinguisme précoce simultané dans un contexte de mixité familiale français-russe. Les recherches récentes dans ce domaine ont montré qu’un ensemble de facteurs tels que l’input parental, ainsi que les stratégies discursives familiales, peuvent expliquer comment l’enfant accède à la parole dans ce contexte (Döpke, 1998 ; Lanza, 1997, 2004 ; De Houwer, 2009 ; King et Fogle, 2013 entre autres). L’enfant bilingue a été enregistrée en interaction spontanée et naturelle avec ses deux parents respectifs sur une durée de deux ans (2;00 à 4;00 ans). Le corpus total est constitué de 68 heures d’enregistrement et l’échantillon analysé a été restreint à 28 heures de transcriptions. Les résultats montrent que la fréquence de l’exposition à l’input et les pratiques langagières familiales ont un impact considérable sur les rapports émergents entre les deux langues à un âge précoce. Il découle de notre analyse que l’enfant développe une forme dominante du bilinguisme et passe progressivement à l’usage harmonieux des deux langues vers 3 ans. Ce passage est accompagné des changements du paysage sonore et de la fréquence de l’exposition à l’input en russe. Un décalage dans l’apparition des catégories grammaticales a été noté : l’acquisition du français suit les modalités générales observées chez les enfants monolingues français, tandis que celle du russe connaît un décalage substantiel. Les transferts interlangues au niveau du lexique, de la morphologie (les fillers) et de la syntaxe permettent de soutenir l’existence des compétences sous-jacentes communes.",

Par ailleurs, certains enfants ou adolescents pratiquent essentiellement le breton dans un milieu scolaire, et nous parlons dans ce cas d'un bilinguisme précoce consécutif.

Parmi les élèves de ces élèves bilingues, quelques enfants pratiquent déjà une langue autre que le français ou le breton et évoluent dans un environnement linguistique encore différent. Certains couples dits mixtes scolarisent leurs enfants dans lune école bilingue car ils perçoivent de type d'établissement comme un endroit favorable aux locuteurs plurilingues. Il nous a paru intéressant d'étudier l'apprentissage du breton au contact des langues pratiquées dans ces familles mixtes.

L’âge d’acquisition des premiers mots varie d’un enfant à l’autre mais il se situe entre le onzième et le quatorzième mois tant pour les monolingues que pour les bilingues. Les orthophonistes sont de plus en plus confrontés à des troubles du langage dans des situations de bilinguisme. En effet le bilinguisme n’est plus un phénomène marginal puisqu’il représente les 2/3 de la population mondiale. Le dépistage précoce des troubles du langage est un enjeu de santé publique. Or, il n’existe à ce jour aucun outil normé et validé pour évaluer le langage en expression et en compréhension de l’enfant bilingue de moins de 3 ans. Des études effectuées sur l’enfant monolingue français de 24 à 32 mois ont permis l’élaboration d’une batterie d’évaluation du langage avec des épreuves de dénomination et de désignation ainsi qu’un questionnaire parental que nous avons adaptés à notre population bilingue français-arabe marocain. Notre population d’étude se compose de 3 groupes d’enfants de 24 à 32 mois. Les analyses descriptives et statistiques montrent d’une part un effet significatif de la variable sexe en faveur des filles, et d’autre part, un effet significatif de l’âge sur l’augmentation des performances aux trois épreuves.

    "title": "Raisonnement et conduites explicatives de bilingues de grande section maternelle tout-venants et suivis en orthophonie",
    "abstract": "Notre recherche s'inscrit dans une méthodologie qualitative exploratoire. Notre premier objectif est de montrer l’effet du bilinguisme précoce sur le développement des compétences métacognitives et du raisonnement logique chez de jeunes enfants de grande section maternelle suivis en orthophonie et tout-venants comparés à leurs pairs monolingues. Notre second objectif est de voir si cet effet diffère selon que les enfants bilingues suivis en orthophonie présentent un bilinguisme simultané ou consécutif. Trente-sept enfants – bilingues franco-arabe, franco-turc et monolingues francophones, scolarisés en grande section maternelle et suivis pour 18 d’entre eux en orthophonie – ont été évalués à l’aide de trois items issus de l’UDN-II (Meljac et Lemmel, 2007). L'analyse des conduites explicatives consécutives au raisonnement logique manipulatoire, propre à ces items, objective, dans la majorité des cas, l’effet du bilinguisme cumulé à celui du travail orthophonique sur le développement des compétences métacognitives et sur le raisonnement logique pour tous les groupes bilingues. Plusieurs observations soulèvent la question du diagnostic différentiel des bilingues suivis en orthophonie et posent l’intérêt de l’analyse des compétences «méta» comme complément au bilan orthophonique de l’enfant bilingue.",

    "abstract": "Il est établi aujourd’hui que notre cerveau est fait pour la cohabitation de plusieurs langues. Cependant, la pratique de plusieurs langues à différents moments de la vie soulève de nombreuses questions. Dans une présentation dialogique accessible à chacun, nous aborderons autant le bilinguisme précoce, l’apprentissage des langues, la pratique quotidienne des langues que les pathologies du langage chez le bilingue. Les deux intervenantes de la soirée sont Vanda Marijanovic et Barbara Köpke du Laboratoire Octogone-Lordat de l’Université Toulouse 2. Elles travaillent dans une perspective interdisciplinaire croisant les sciences du langage, la psychologie et les langues, sous la direction de Madame Köpke. Le laboratoire Octogone-Lordat est spécialisé dans les recherches neuro-psycholinguistiques autour des (dys)fonctionnements langagiers ainsi que l’apprentissage linguistique. L’un des axes de recherche porte précisément sur l’apprentissage ou l’acquisition des langues et le bilinguisme. Au cours de la soirée, en partant des questions fréquemment posées sur le bilinguisme, nous apporterons des éléments de réponse fournis par les sciences du cerveau et de la cognition par rapport à certaines idées reçues sur le bilinguisme. Nous partirons pour cela de différentes situations qui se présentent au cours de la vie avec deux langues : le développement langagier de l’enfant bilingue, les spécificités de l’utilisation des langues chez les personnes bilingues, ainsi que le vieillissement sain et pathologique chez le sujet bilingue. Les collègues du Goethe-Institut illustreront les points abordés avec leurs propres expériences. La présentation sera suivie par un échange entre les publics et toutes les intervenantes.",

    "abstract": "La maitrise de la langue est un élément essentiel dans l’épanouissement de la personnalité d’un enfant, pour sa réussite scolaire, mais aussi pour son intégration sociale et sa future insertion professionnelle. En France, un enfant sur deux, dans les grandes villes, parle une ou plusieurs autres langues que le français à la maison. Comme ont pu l’observer les professionnels de la MSP de Tomblaine, des difficultés de langage peuvent être observées dans certains cas chez ces enfants. L’objectif principal était de concevoir et mettre en oeuvre une action territoriale à destination des parents d’enfants bilingues précoces de Tomblaine afin d’améliorer la qualité de vie de ces enfants. Des stratégies d’intervention ont été élaborées à partir d’une revue de la littérature, de rencontres avec les professionnels de terrain, mais également d’une étude observationnelle sur les habitudes familiales de transmission des langues et sur les représentations du bilinguisme des professionnels. Un petit-déjeuner d’information à destination des parents et futurs parents a été organisé et a réuni 24 personnes. Ce temps d’échange sera complété par la sensibilisation des professionnels locaux au bilinguisme, par la mise en place d’un protocole pluriprofessionnel de soins de premier recours au sein de la MSP et enfin par des ateliers parents et futurs parents. Ces actions devront cependant s’orienter vers un axe plus communautaire. Ce travail a également montré l’intérêt pour les Maisons de Santé Pluriprofessionnelles de faire intervenir un professionnel formé à la méthodologie de projet en santé publique.",

    "title": "Quelle horreur ! Traduction et diffusion en France du genre horrifique en littérature jeunesse dans les années 1990",
    "abstract": "Les littératures d’horreur pour adultes et pour la jeunesse, bien qu’elles trouvent leurs racines dans la littérature gothique du XVIIIe siècle pour la première et les récits moraux et d’instruction des XVIIIe et XIXe siècles pour la seconde, constituent un phénomène éditorial relativement récent et avant tout anglophone. Si l’horreur pour adultes s’essouffle pendant la décennie 1990, c’est à cette époque qu’elle bat son plein dans l’édition pour la jeunesse. La réaction des figures prescriptrices de la littérature jeunesse est pour le moins mitigée et l'on critique le genre horrifique aussi bien pour son contenu jugé inapproprié que pour les stratégies de commercialisation qui accompagnent sa diffusion, qui évoquent celles des littératures populaires en général, \"à la fois bon marché et cherch[ent] le profit en ciblant le plus grand nombre de lecteurs possibles\" (Langlet 2019 : 947). Littératures populaires et littérature jeunesse partagent des logiques commerciales qui se sont mises en place après 1945 (concentration et concurrence des maisons d’édition, stratégies de fidélisation du lectorat, internationalisation du marché éditorial, production industrielle), et dont le genre horrifique va bénéficier pour se développer. Parmi les outils décisifs, on compte le recours à la traduction et aux logiques sérielles. La traduction joue ainsi un rôle central dans la diffusion de cette littérature en France : elle contribue à construire un architexte horrifique aussi bien pour le lectorat adulte que pour le lectorat jeunesse. Dans le cadre de la littérature jeunesse, les œuvres d’horreur ne se font pas connaître grâce à des titres individuels, mais plutôt grâce aux séries et collections qui s’appuient sur « des traductions massives de littératures de genre » (Lévêque 2019 : 1036). À l’instar de leurs consœurs anglophones , les collections et séries françaises vont faire naître et diffuser dans le paysage littéraire un genre horrifique pour la jeunesse qui s’affranchit de la règle dominante à l’époque en littérature jeunesse ; Geneviève Brisac (directrice de collections à L’École des loisirs) la résume ainsi en 1999 : \"contrairement à ce qui peut se passer en littérature générale, ce qui dérange et provoque est mis de côté : il ne faut pas inquiéter.\" (citée dans Perrin 2014 : 15) À travers les exemples de \"Chair de poule\" (1995-2001) et \"Peur bleue\" (1997-2001), ce chapitre aborde la façon dont le genre horrifique constitue dans la décennie 1990 son identité auprès des lectorats enfant et adolescent français, revendiquant une horreur spécifique pour la jeunesse et profondément influencée par la culture américaine.",

En effet, un des objectifs de l'enseignement de la littérature de jeunesse dans les programmes de 2008 est de contribuer à la formation de la personne et du citoyen. Parallèlement, nous constatons que les projets destinés à sensibiliser les élèves au handicap visuel ne prennent que rarement appui sur des livres de jeunesse. Pourtant, la littérature de jeunesse a une valeur éducative : elle constitue une ouverture sur le monde et interroge les valeurs éthiques. C'est pourquoi les livres de jeunesse apparaissent comme un medium approprié pour aborder la question du handicap visuel avec les plus jeunes. Actuellement, cette thématique est plus développée dans les éditions de livres de poche pour le collège. C'est pour cette raison que nous nous pencherons sur les ouvrages destinés aux élèves de l'école primaire en nous demandant comment la littérature de jeunesse peut les sensibiliser à la question de la déficience visuelle.",

    "title": "Figures de l’émancipation féminine et masculine dans la littérature de jeunesse de 2000 à aujourd’hui",
    "abstract": "Malgré l’évolution de la société et de la condition féminine, une grande partie de la littérature de jeunesse d’aujourd’hui véhicule encore des stéréotypes sexistes. Quelques éditeurs et associations s’engagent pour combattre les idées reçues dans la littérature de jeunesse et notamment les stéréotypes de genre. Paradoxalement, cette littérature de jeunesse participe pour partie à l’enracinement des stéréotypes de genre, et tente aussi de déconstruire ces stéréotypes sexistes en donnant une autre vision de la femme, de l’homme et des rapports hommes/femmes. Depuis les années 1960, de nombreuses études ont été faites sur la représentation des personnages féminins et masculins dans la littérature enfantine. J’ai décidé de travailler plus particulièrement sur des ouvrages qui luttent contre les stéréotypes de genre. D’après mes recherches, voici la typologie que j’ai définie afin d’illustrer les différents sous-thèmes de la littérature de jeunesse : la confrontation de stéréotypes et de contre-stéréotypes sous forme narrative (T. Lenain, C. Proteaux, <i>Menu fille ou menu garçon ?</i> Nathan, 1996 ; S. Carquain, E. Blain, <i>Les lutines se mutinent</i>, Talents hauts, 2009) ; la présence d’antihéros et d’antihéroïnes (N. Hense, I. Green, <i>Marre du rose</i>, Albin Michel Jeunesse, 2009), le droit à la différence (B. Lacombe, <i>Longs cheveux</i>, Talents hauts, 2010), les figures de l’émancipation, la déconstruction en acte des stéréotypes (M.-S. Roger, A. Sol, <i>À quoi tu joues ?</i>, Sarbacane, 2009 ; T. Lenain, <i>Mademoiselle Zazie a-t-elle un zizi ?</i>, Nathan, 2004), l’introduction d’un troisième personnage dit neutre pour dépasser le schéma binaire garçon, fille (G. Raisson, C. Perrin, <i>T'es fleur ou t'es chou ?</i>, Rue du monde, 2008) et le détournement des contes traditionnels (S. Servant, L. Le Saux, <i>Boucle d’ours</i>, Didier Jeunesse, 2013 ; G. Aymon, J. Castanié, <i>La Princesse Rose-Praline</i>, Talents hauts, 2010). Cette typologie regroupant un nombre important de titres, j’ai réduit mon sujet à l’un de ces sous-thèmes, à savoir : les figures d’émancipation.La thématique de l’émancipation est intéressante pour plusieurs raisons. Elle est d’abord présente de manière inégale dans la littérature de jeunesse du cycle 1 au cycle 3 : elle est absente ou presque du cycle 1 et est davantage abordée au cycle 3. De plus, le terme « émancipation » est polysémique et intrinsèquement lié à un contexte politique, juridique et historique. J’ai décidé d’étudier les figures de l’émancipation, à la fois des personnages féminins et des personnages masculins. Le corpus se compose de sept œuvres publiées entre 2001 et 2014. La première partie de ce corpus est composée de trois œuvres illustrant l’affranchissement d’une autorité ou d’une domination. Il s’agit de <i>Vite, vite, chère Marie !</i> (Niels Mogens Bodecker et Erik Blegvad, 2004), <i>À calicochon</i> (Anthony Browne, 2013) et de <i>L'Histoire impossible à peindre</i> (Claire Ubac, 2004).",

    "title": "Le roman d'aventures maritime en littérature de jeunesse... Quels héros, quels lecteurs ?",
    "abstract": "Pour commencer cette étude, nous essaierons de cerner d'un peu plus près la notion même de roman d'aventures, tout d'abord en le replaçant dans le contexte plus large du récit et du roman, puis en retraçant son évolution historique et en dégageant les principales caractéristiques du genre. Enfin nous nous intéresserons aux rapports entretenus entre le roman d'aventure et la littérature de jeunesse. Ensuite, nous nous interrogerons sur le roman d'aventures maritime, sur ses propres caractéristiques par rapport à celles du roman d'aventures, sur son histoire. Nous tenterons de d'observer les différents types d'aventures en mer dans la littérature de jeunesse d'aujourd'hui. Puis nous nous intéresserons aux héros de romans d'aventures en mer, si ces héros possèdent toujours les mêmes caractéristiques ou bien s'il y a des différences notables entre eux ; et ensuite aux héroïnes, à leur présence historique et littéraire en mer, à leur présence dans les romans d'aventures de littérature de jeunesse, à leurs ressemblances et/ou leurs différences par rapport aux héros. Cette comparaison sera réalisée à travers un corpus de romans d'aventures en mer, mettant en scène un héros, une héroïne ou un héros et une héroïne « embarqués » ensemble. Ce corpus sera limité - pour l'essentiel - aux romans de littérature de jeunesse dont le héros est un adolescent, mais il pourra être fait référence à des romans mettant en scène des héros adultes. Enfin, nous étudierons la question de la conception de l'aventure aujourd'hui, en particulier pour les adolescents. Quelle place tiennent l'aventure et l'aventure marine dans la production actuelle en littérature de jeunesse ? Quelle place les adolescents réservent-ils au roman d'aventures dans leurs lectures ? Qui lit le plus, entre les garçons et les filles, ce genre de romans ? À partir de ces réflexions, nous tenterons d'observer les possibilités d'avenir du roman d'aventures.",

    "title": "Mise en valeur des livres de jeunesse : éléments d'analyse critique et empirique en vue de la conception d'une rubrique internet",
    "abstract": "La reconnaissance de la littérature de jeunesse passe par sa reconnaissance par la critique. Or, aujourd'hui, la critique ne se cantonne plus comme il y a quelques années à des revues spécialisées dirigées pour la plupart vers des professionnels. L'Internet a également ouvert sa toile à la critique, et tout particulièrement, à l'analyse des livres pour enfants. Depuis 1994, un troisième pôle a pris place au sein même du Service Commun de la Documentation de l'Université Lille III. L'un des objectifs de la Bibliothèque des Bibliothèques était de contribuer à la reconnaissance universitaire de la littérature de jeunesse et de jouer un rôle dans la légitimation des livres pour enfants grâce à son secteur jeunesse puis, à partir de 1998, à son site Internet de littérature de jeunesse. Le stage à la Bibliothèque des Bibliothèques se situait dans une problématique de réécriture critique des ouvrages pour enfants comme mode de légitimation et comme critère de diffusion. En effet, mon travail au sein du secteur jeunesse de la BDB consistait à concevoir un outil de sélection sur le site de littérature de jeunesse. Cet outil, tout en s'adressant à un public beaucoup plus large, devait apporter une aide directe aux acquisitions des professionnels. La conception d'une rubrique de sélection sur l'Internet supposait un projet d'où la nécessité de mettre en place un état des lieux et une évaluation. Ces derniers devaient apporter deux types de connaissance : une connaissance des analyses critiques en littérature de jeunesse et une connaissance des pratiques professionnelles en matière de sélection. Par ailleurs, les rubriques de sélection existant déjà dans les revues ou sur le réseau Internet, il était nécessaire que je m'interroge sur la comparaison entre ces deux formes lors de l'état des lieux et de l'évaluation du projet.",

    "title": "Repenser la notion d'engagement dans les albums sur la question des dominations",
    "abstract": "La littérature engagée, dont l’âge d’or se situe à la sortie de la Seconde Guerre mondiale, se caractérise aujourd’hui par une reconfiguration avec de nouvelles formes et de nouveaux thèmes. En littérature de jeunesse, l'engagement tend à se confondre avec l'éducation à la citoyenneté. Cette reconfiguration questionne le risque d'une littérature politiquement correcte voire moralisatrice. Pour identifier une littérature engagée, nous nous intéressons ici à l’engagement esthétique et politique d’un corpus de six albums sur la question des dominations, plus spécifiquement sur la domination sociale. En effet, la domination est un thème important de la littérature engagée mais peu présent en littérature de jeunesse, plus particulièrement dans les albums. L’analyse porte sur les formes, les enjeux et les limites de l’engagement esthétique et politique sur la question des dominations dans les albums. Cet engagement est déterminé à partir d’une définition de la littérature engagée. Celle-ci se décline autour de trois gestes d’écriture : (s’)exposer, dire le juste et l’injuste, agir. L’analyse qui repose sur ces trois gestes questionne l’engagement de l’auteur, du lecteur et en fait émerger les limites. La particularité des albums implique également le rôle du médiateur pour inviter les enfants à penser les dominations. Ces réflexions permettent de repenser les spécificités de la littérature de jeunesse engagée.",

    "abstract": "Nous nous bornerons à l'étude des livres-jeunesse. Ce travail comportera quatre parties. La première partie est consacrée au statut de l'écrivain-jeunesse et à ses écrits. Cette partie s'inscrit dans le prolongement du travail qu'a effectué Isabelle Jan dans son livre intitulé Les livres pour la jeunesse Un enjeu pour l'avenir. Un entretien réalisé auprès de Valérie Dayre sera analysé afin de vérifier ou de rectifier l'étude d'Isabelle Jan réalisée dans les années 80 ; cette dernière a rendu compte du peu de reconnaissance dont souffraient les écrivains-jeunesse. La deuxième partie s'inscrit dans le courant méthodologique qui vise à montrer la littérarité des œuvres pour la jeunesse. Ainsi cette partie constituera une étude littéraire qui montrera la richesse et la diversité des œuvres de Valérie Dayre ; en effet, il semble, de prime abord, que passant d'un livre à un autre, nous entrons dans des univers différents ; il y a cependant des constantes dans les récits de Valérie Dayre que nous tâcherons de vous révéler. En outre, nous verrons que son œuvre s'inscrit également dans la continuité, la tradition de la littérature de jeunesse. La troisième partie montrera que certaines œuvres pourraient permettre d'explorer, dans le cadre scolaire, des disciplines nouvelles. Cette perspective pédagogique, qui ne semble pas compatible avec l'étude précédente, davantage axée sur la littérarité, permettra cependant de montrer que des liens entre littérature de jeunesse et pédagogie peuvent continuer d'exister à condition de répondre aux réels soucis des jeunes. La dernière partie est axée sur la réception des œuvres de Valérie Dayre, des entretiens menés auprès d'enfants âgés de 8 à 14 ans, portent sur la compréhension des textes, la perception des métaphores.",

    "title": "Genèse, hégémonie et déclin de la <i>learnability condition</i> : épistémologie de la psycholinguistique développementale",
    "abstract": "Le problème de l'acquisition linguistique mobilise une foule de savoirs : des connaissances sur les capacités cognitives de l'enfant et de l'adulte, des connaissances concernant ce qui est à apprendre (la langue maîtrisée par le sujet), des connaissances concernant la base neurologique et génétique du comportement verbal, parfois même des connaissances concernant la communication animale. Chacun de ces domaines, chacune des diverses positions que nous parcourrons implique une conception, à un niveau élevé de généralité, de l'intelligence humaine, du langage humain, de l'enfance et de l'apprentissage. Bien qu'examinées ici par la méthode scientifique (et plutôt dirions-nous des méthodes scientifiques) les questions traitées n'en sont pas moins des problèmes philosophiques autrefois traités par exemple par les théories classiques de la connaissance (Descartes, Locke, Hume, Leibniz). Notre but sera de comprendre et de confronter les savoir scientifiques récemment fournis sur ces questions classiquement philosophiques. Le travail épistémologique sera donc double : premièrement, confronter le savoir donné vis-à-vis des méthodes de vérification par lequel ce savoir est atteint. Particulièrement dans ce travail, nous montrerons l'erreur méthodologique qui consiste à traiter un problème empirique sur la base de catégories logiques et à se fier à une idée <i>a priori</i> concernant la course développementale linguistique de l'enfant. C'est en observant la genèse (son lien avec l’expérience de pensée fameuse de Quine), la défense puis la critique du <i>learnability problem</i> que nous pourrons souligner cette erreur méthodologique. Secondement, en philosophe, nous essaierons d'observer les postulats philosophiques (au sens de très généraux) mobilisés dans ces diverses doctrines concernant l'homme, le langage, l'intelligence, l’esprit ; et d'examiner leurs implications sur la doctrine produite. Notre travail consistera à remonter les différentes notions scientifiques que nous parcourrons vers leurs bases philosophiques les plus profondes. Ainsi nous pourrons entreprendre notre analyse épistémologique depuis deux sources : la confrontation du savoir et de ses méthodes de vérification, la confrontation entre différentes analyses scientifiques ainsi que leurs postulats fondamentaux, à un niveau, encore une fois, philosophique.",

    "title": "Origines cognitives, cérébrales et génétiques des troubles de l'acquisition du langage",
    "abstract": "Le thème général qui m'intéresse et qui unifie les différentes branches de mes recherches passées et présentes est celui du développement cérébral et cognitif. Au sein de ce thème je m'intéresse plus particulièrement à l'acquisition du langage, avec une approche résolument pluridisciplinaire. Les questions qui se situent au cœur de ma recherche sont: Quels sont les mécanismes cognitifs qui permettent l'acquisition du langage par l'enfant? Comment ces mécanismes se développent-ils dans le cerveau du nourrisson? Comment le génome humain peut-il construire un cerveau qui a le potentiel de développer de tels mécanismes? J'utilise plusieurs approches convergentes pour tenter de répondre à ces questions. L'une consiste à étudier les capacités perceptives précoces qui constituent le socle des premières acquisitions linguistiques du nourrisson, leurs bases cérébrales, et leurs origines évolutives. Une autre approche est celle de la pathologie. Ma recherche d'un modèle neuropsychologique de l'acquisition du langage m'a naturellement con\\-duit à l'étude de la dyslexie développementale, qui est aujourd'hui mon principal sujet de recherche. Après avoir mené des études expérimentales systématiques des différentes théories de la dyslexie, mes travaux se poursuivent dans deux directions. L'une consiste à explorer en grand détail le déficit phonologique à la base de la plupart des cas de dyslexie, en utilisant les méthodes de la psycholinguistique, dans le but de comprendre dans quelle mesure les mécanismes d'acquisition du langage se développent de manière déviante chez l'enfant dyslexique. L'autre se tourne résolument vers la biologie dans le but de comprendre les origines cérébrales et génétiques du déficit phonologique. En me basant sur les données neurobiologiques disponibles, j'ai proposé un modèle permettant de comprendre l'étiologie et la diversité des symptômes cognitifs associés à la dyslexie et plus généralement à d'autres troubles neuro-développementaux. L'un de mes objectifs est de tester ce modèle par des études d'imagerie cérébrale et de génétique des troubles de l'acquisition du langage (dyslexie et dysphasie). Au-delà de cette approche par la pathologie, la perspective à long terme est d'éclairer les processus biologiques impliqués dans le développement des systèmes neuronaux qui contribuent à certains mécanismes d'acquisition du langage.",

    "abstract": "A un an du cinquantenaire officiel de la psycholinguistique, j'en exposerai quelques avancées dans le domaine de l'acquisition et de la pathologie du langage chez l'enfant, dans une tradition d'écologie conversationnelle. les premières recherches ont porté sur les premiers mots des enfants, leurs premiers agencements syntaxiques, l'acquisition de la phonologie et de la morphologie. La mise à l'épreuve du terrain ainsi que des discussions théoriques célèbres (débat Chomsky, Piaget, Vygotsky, ...) ont fait porter l'attention des chercheurs sur les contextes d'acquisition ; interactions privilégiées avec un ou quelques adultes, parents ou éducateurs, interactions entre enfants. Ceci a permis de développer les notions de complexité et de variabilité des conduites communicatives. Les premiers travaux ont porté sur des interactions relativement ponctuelles et ont cherché à observer des effets immédiats. L'étude développementale et longitudinale de longues périodes qui semblaient \"prélinguistiques\" ou encore de phénomènes dits traditionnellement \"extralinguistiques\" (intonation, prosodie) avec des moyens nouveaux d'observation, montre que les effets d'imprégnation sont précoces et agissent par réitération et variation. L'étude de l'acquisition dans un contexte de remédiation montre que l'imitation ou ce qui semble tel se construit à long terme par décentrements successifs d'éléments complémentaires et coordonnés. Il est donc nécessaire d'étudier une grammaire du dialogue, et des genres en contexte d'acquisition lors d'activités solitaires ou conjointes (avec différents adultes ou enfants) en relation avec un monde d'objets divers, de plus en plus complexe lui aussi. L'étude de la pathologie ne pourra que gagner à l'amélioration des méthodes d'analyse quantitatives et qualitatives de la variation de l'acquisition en milieu mono ou multilingue. Il semble que face aux développements des recherches cognitives fortement modélisantes la psycholinguistique a encore un rôle singulier à jouer en relation avec des disciplines connexes.",

    "title": "Morphométrie de trois sillons d'intérêt dans la dyslexie développementale",
    "abstract": "La dyslexie développementale est un trouble spécifique de l'apprentissage de la lecture qui affecte 3 à 7% des enfants d'âge scolaire. Il est bien établi aujourd'hui que la dyslexie découle en partie de variations génétiques qui causent des changements lors du développement cérébral, qui, à leur tour, ont des conséquences au niveau cognitif. Cette thèse s'appuie sur les analyses morphométriques de trois des sillons principaux du cerveau dans trois grands ensembles de données d'imagerie par résonance magnétique : 102 participants français, 80 participants polonais et 70 participants allemands, avec, dans chaque jeu de données, environ la moitié de participants ayant été diagnostiqués dyslexiques et la moitié de lecteurs normaux. J'ai étudié le sillon central, la scissure Sylvienne et le sillon temporal supérieur grâce aux outils de labellisation automatique et de mesures du logiciel BrainVISA. J'ai mesuré des propriétés quantitatives (surface et profondeur) ainsi que des propriétés qualitatives (configuration) de chaque sillon. J'ai montré une triple interaction entre groupe, sexe et hémisphère dans la profondeur moyenne du sillon central, laissant penser que les participants contrôles et dyslexiques diffèrent en terme d'asymétrie de profondeur de ce sillon. Comme la sulcation est un processus se déroulant de façon précoce lors du développement du cerveau et qui semble moins plastique que d'autres mesures cérébrales (comme, par exemple, les volumes de matière grise), ce résultat pourrait s'avérer être un marqueur précoce du risque de dyslexie plutôt que la conséquence de mauvaises capacités de lecture.",

    "title": "LES MOTS COMPLEXES EN FRANÇAIS CONTEMPORAIN : POUR QUI N'A PAS GRANDI AVEC LE « DINOTRAIN »…",
    "abstract": "Les mots complexes comme « fleur horloge » ou « Dinotrain » sont à l'articulation du lexique et de la syntaxe (Arnaud et Renner, 2014). Longtemps négligés ou peu décrits autrement que comme « mots composés », catégorieà géométrie variable puisquepour certains linguistes au moinselle comprend aussi des noms modifiés par un adjectif ou par un syntagme prépositionnel (Riegel et al. 2009 :912), les mots complexesfont l'objet d'un regain d'intérêt, en tant que créations lexicales permettant de véhiculer de nouvelles significations. Les travaux récents analysent les aspects morphologiques, mais aussi sémantiques de ces créations, dans une perspective synchronique ou diachronique, et souvent translinguistique (Lieber et Stekauer, 2009, Scalise et Vogel, 2010). La psycholinguistique développementale s'intéresse également à ces unités étonnamment proches des premières combinaisons à deux termes que produisent tous les enfants du monde (voir par ex. François et al, 1977 ; Tomasello & Brooks, 1999),et qui peuvent être assimilées à une ébauche de syntaxe. Prenant acte de travaux portant sur l'acquisition d'une langue maternelle ou de langues étrangères, mais aussi sur les troubles du langage comme l'aphasie, Jackendoffvoit dans la composition un principe primitif (Malmkjaer, 2010 : 318). Après Bickerton (1990), pour qui les langues modernes constituaient des évolutions sur la base d'un substrat, ou protolangage, Jackendoff (1999 : 276) analyse en effet les composés de la langue anglaise comme d'éventuels « fossiles » de ce protolangage. La plupart des travaux portent sur les langues germaniques (et en grande majorité sur l'anglais) mais la présence de tels composés en français, si elle reconnue depuis la fin du 19 ème siècle 2 , reste assez peu étudiée,à part dans quelques travaux récents qui abordent la question dans une perspective lexicologique et terminologique (voir par ex. Arnaud, 2003 ; Arnaud et Renner, 2014). En psycholinguistique, cette question a principalement été abordée comparativement, pour voir si des différences de traitement des mots composés pouvaient être observées chez les enfants francophones (voir par ex. Nicoladis et Krott, 2007). Les hypothèses développementales reposent sur le repérage de différences structurelles entre les langues germaniques et les langues romanes : la fréquence d'utilisation des procédés de composition à l'oeuvre dans les mots composés est considérablement moins importante en français, où l'on utilise plus couramment des syntagmes prépositionnels.Pour reprendre un exemple de Nicoladis (2003 : 320), là où l'anglais utilise coffee cup, le français utilise tasse à café. Nous présentons ici les résultats d'une expérience pilote en classe de CE2-CM1, qui permettent de décrire et d'analyser la préférence des locuteurs pour la composition lorsqu'il s'agit de nommer des objets hybrides.",

    "abstract": "L'objectif est de présenter un éclairage psycholinguistique sur la question de la traduction automatique des langues en prenant en compte la problématique des interactions intra et extralangagières dans le dialogue et notamment les problèmes liés aux substrats culturels. La communication précédente montre qu'il n'est pas évident pour un système d'identifier ce qui est dit, d'interpréter pourquoi cela est dit et de déterminer quoi dire en réponse en faisant preuve d'un certain degré d'adaptabilité à l'utilisateur. Nous ajoutons à ces considérations que le système devrait aussi repérer le rapport entre ce qui est dit, qui le dit, à qui et ceci en tenant compte de variables culturelles et développementale. Plus précisément, cette approche psycholinguistique souligne la complexité de la construction de l'échange en langue cible lorsque le formatage de la communication est conçu différemment selon des variables telles que les dimensions spatiales et contextuelles. <b>Plan</b> <b>1.

La thèse répond en proposant, au plan théorique, l'utilisation du concept de médiateur. Un médiateur est une trace discursive que l'on rattache à un processus sousjacent de construction/redéfinition des positions subjectives au sein de l'espace intersubjectif. La recherche exploite ensuite des corpus acquis expérimentalement pour extraire le schéma de sens invariant du médiateur \"bon\", et relever les étapes développemenatles de sa reconstruction entre 5 et 9 ans, comparativement à l'âge adulte. Une analyse empirique des conversations clôt la recherche. Elle dégage l'intérêt qu'il y a à étudier les sites particulies d'emploi des médiateurs pour avancer dans l'étude de l'enchaînement interlocutoire.",

    "title": "Acquisition du langage en Langue des Signes Française (LSF) : de la communication prélinguistique aux premiers signes",
    "abstract": "Ce projet s’inscrit dans le cadre des recherches en psycholinguistique sur l’acquisition du langage en langues des signes (dorénavant LS), langues à modalité visuo-gestuelle utilisées par les communautés sourdes. Les signes (employés ici comme équivalents de « mots ») sont les unités lexicales des LS. Les travaux relatifs à l’acquisition du langage en LS ont montré que les enfants signeurs suivent la même trajectoire développementale que les enfants entendants qui acquièrent une langue vocale (Petitto, 1988 ; Newport & Meier, 1985). Point important, la communication précoce des enfants signeurs et entendants est marquée par l’utilisation de différents types de gestes communicatifs qui précèdent et accompagnent le développement lexical. Or en LS, le medium d’expression étant unimodal par nature, gestes et signes sont produits dans la seule modalité visuo-gestuelle. Dès lors, la question qui se pose et qui constitue la base de ce travail est la suivante : comment se réorganisent et s’articulent les moyens de communication (répertoire gestuel communicatif et gestuel linguistique) du jeune enfant signeur dans le développement langagier précoce ? L’analyse de cette articulation geste-signe est effectuée à partir d’un corpus longitudinal d’interactions spontanées entre enfants et parents sourds signeurs. Nous présenterons la méthodologie employée pour le recueil de données ainsi que les difficultés rencontrées dans la constitution du corpus. Nous détaillerons ensuite le schéma d’annotation développé avant de présenter les premiers résultats concernant la période d’émergence des premiers gestes et signes entre 9 et 13 mois.",

    "abstract": "On a demandé à des enfants francophones unilingues âges de 4 a 11 ans et à des adultes de décrire oralement 9 triplets d'images dont les composantes prennent différentes valeurs sur la dimension pragmatique ancienneté vs nouveauté d'une information. Dans la première image de chaque série, tous les éléments sont nouveaux. Dans la deuxième et la troisième image, un élément est remplacé a chaque fois par un nouvel élément alors que les autres éléments composant l'image prennent un caractère accru d'ancienneté. On étudie l'émergence de 3 fonctions essentielles accomplies respectivement par les tournures présentatives (« c'est » et « ya ») et Ie clivage : l'introduction et la mise en valeur d'un élément référentiel ainsi que le contraste entre éléments supposés être et n'être pas partagés par l'interlocuteur. On note, a tout âge, un usage plus fréquent des constructions en « c'est ». Dès 6 ans, l'emploi du clivage l'emporte sur celui du seul présentatif. Mais il n'est pas utilisé pour introduire une composante nouvelle de l'image. Il introduit un élement en fonction sujet dans l'énoncé et presque toujours agent dans la situation décrite. Sa fréquence d'emploi décroît au fur et à mesure que, dans son ensemble, la situation perd de sa nouveauté. L'emploi du clivage semble obéir à des impératifs de contrôle de l'introduction, dans le discours, d'une proposition nouvelle qui marque une rupture dans la succession des triplets d'images, plutôt qu'à celui du contraste nouveau vs ancien de l'une des composantes.",

    "title": "Appréhender la socialisation langagière : perspectives sociocognitives, interactionnelles et éducatives",
    "abstract": "La socialisation désigne la transformation chez un individu d’un état de novice à un état de membre expert d’un groupe social (Kulick &amp; Schieffelin, 2004; Ochs &amp; Schieffelin, 1984, 1995). Ce manuscrit rédigé en vue d’une habilitation à diriger des recherches pourra alors être conçu transversalement comme la mise en mots de ma propre trajectoire de socialisation en tant qu’enseignant.e et chercheur.e de l’enseignement supérieur. En effet, au fil des chapitres de ce manuscrit, je présente mes travaux de recherche et expériences d’enseignement sous cet éclairage, afin de tracer mon propre chemin parcouru jusqu’à aujourd’hui. Mes recherches se centrent essentiellement sur l’exploration de différentes facettes sous-tendant l’acquisition et la socialisation plurilingue, en portant une attention particulière sur les phénomènes de variation dans les choix de langues ainsi que sur la façon dont les enfants et les adolescent.es perçoivent et catégorisent la variation linguistique. Le langage, au cœur de ce processus de socialisation, joue un rôle fondamental, car le novice (qu’il soit adulte ou enfant) se socialise par le langage et apprend en même temps les pratiques langagières acceptées, voire valorisées, par son groupe social d’appartenance (Ochs &amp; Schieffelin, 1984, 1995). Dès mes premiers travaux de recherche, l’adoption d’une approche interdisciplinaire m’est apparue incontournable pour mieux comprendre les spécificités de l’environnement langagier au sein duquel l’enfant acquiert les pratiques langagières perçues comme étant appropriées par les membres de sa communauté. Fédérant les cadres théoriques et méthodologiques issus de la psycholinguistique, de la sociolinguistique et de la linguistique interactionnelle, je me suis intéressée à la manière dont l’enfant se saisit du langage pour devenir un acteur social, en particulier au sein de situations de contact de langues. Cette synthèse propose un panorama thématique des travaux que j’ai menés jusqu’à présent. En conséquence, elle n’est en aucun cas exhaustive car seuls les points les plus représentatifs de mon parcours feront l’objet d’une discussion approfondie, pour montrer la façon dont ma réflexion scientifique a évolué au fil des années. Ce travail s’articule autour de quatre parties principales. Dans la première partie, qui lie les perspectives psycholinguistique et sociolinguistique, je me concentre sur le rôle de la variation dans les processus d’acquisition et de socialisation bilingues. La deuxième partie porte sur le développement pragmatique et sur l’acquisition des pratiques bilingues en interaction, à travers l’approche de l’anthropologie linguistique. La troisième partie explore le versant perceptif de la socialisation qui me permet de discuter de la trajectoire développementale de la catégorisation de la variation linguistique par la mise en place de protocoles expérimentaux. Enfin, dans la quatrième partie, j’expose les perspectives de recherche pour les prochaines années à venir, en précisant la façon dont j’envisage de nouer mes activités de recherche et d’enseignement, deux dimensions essentielles du métier d’enseignant.e et de chercheur.e.",

    "title": "Le rôle de la prédiction sémantique et syntaxique et de l’apprentissage statistique dans la lecture normale et dans la dyslexie développementale.",
    "abstract": "L’idée du cerveau prédictif est devenue un concept clé en neuroscience et en science cognitives. Selon cette idée, le cerveau serait une « machine » à faire des prédictions sur les événements futurs et chercherait à minimiser les erreurs de ces prédictions, ce qui est la base d'un apprentissage implicite et adaptatif. Si la prédiction intervient dans de nombreux domaines cognitifs différents, les chercheurs qui étudient le langage ont été particulièrement actifs dans l'exploration du rôle de la prédiction dans la lecture. En effet, la lecture ne se limite pas à l'interprétation immédiate des mots, mais implique également une anticipation active de ce qui pourrait suivre, basée sur le contexte linguistique et les régularités statistiques. À ce jour, un nombre croissant d'études ont également tenté de déterminer si les compétences en apprentissage statistique ou AS (capacité à extraire des régularités statistiques pour faire des prédictions et former des attentes) pouvaient expliquer les différences interindividuelles dans les capacités de lecture au sein de la population générale (avec et sans troubles de la lecture). Dans le domaine de la dyslexie, il a été montré que les dyslexiques adultes utilisent davantage les informations linguistiques de haut niveau (sémantique, morphologie, syntaxe) pour « compenser » leurs déficits dans le traitement orthographique et phonologique, ce qui reviendrait à une forme de prédiction. Cependant, même si plusieurs aspects des processus de prédiction dans le langage ont été exploré, il existe encore quelques lacunes dans notre compréhension, ce qui nécessite des recherches supplémentaires. En effet la plupart des études ont porté sur des niveaux assez généraux de compétence en lecture plutôt que sur des processus plus dynamiques consistant à faire des prédictions linguistiques. De plus, si les études sur l’AS exploitent effectivement les mécanismes d'apprentissage du monde réel, on devrait s'attendre à des relations fiables entre l’AS et la lecture. Pourtant, il existe un réel débat dans la littérature concernant le lien entre compétence en lecture et AS ou encore la présence d’un déficit ou non d’AS dans la dyslexie. Ce conflit dans la littérature pose un défi fondamental pour notre compréhension du rôle de l’AS dans le langage et, plus généralement, dans la cognition. Dans cette thèse, nous aborderons les questions suivantes : Quel est le rôle de la prédiction sémantique et syntaxique dans la lecture à voix haute ? Les bons lecteurs, ainsi que les bons « compreneurs », sont-ils de bons prédicteurs linguistiques ? Et si les prédictions linguistiques reposent bien sur une capacité plus « domain-general » d’AS, les bons prédicteurs sont-ils également de bons « statistical learners » ? Enfin, ce potentiel lien entre prédiction linguistiques et non linguistiques joue-t-il un rôle dans la dyslexie développementale et quels sont les bases neurales de ces différents types de prédictions ? Cette thèse fait un lien avec trois domaines de la psychologie cognitive : la psycholinguistique de la lecture, les modèles de prédiction et l'apprentissage statistique. Enfin, nous apporterons des nouvelles connaissances théoriques à ce sujet en évaluant les effets de prédiction chez les adultes dyslexiques, mais également en précisant la nature de ces informations, la localisation précise des réseaux neuronaux impliqués dans la prédiction, et la dissociation entre les processus sémantiques et syntaxiques.",
