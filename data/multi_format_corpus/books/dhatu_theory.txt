Dhatu Theory and Semantic Roots

Dhatu are the fundamental semantic units in Sanskrit grammar.
They represent the irreducible roots of meaning in language.

Origins
The concept of dhatu comes from Panini's Ashtadhyayi.
These roots form the basis of word formation and meaning.

Application to Computing
In PaniniFS, we apply dhatu theory to content analysis.
By identifying semantic roots, we can deduplicate content at the meaning level.

Benefits
- Language-independent content addressing
- Semantic deduplication across translations
- Universal content patterns

Implementation
Modern NLP combined with dhatu theory enables breakthrough compression.
