Introduction to PaniniFS

PaniniFS is a revolutionary filesystem that separates container structure from semantic content.
This allows for optimized compression and intelligent content addressing.

Chapter 1: The Problem
Traditional filesystems treat all files as opaque byte sequences.
This approach misses opportunities for semantic optimization and deduplication.

Chapter 2: The Solution
PaniniFS analyzes content at three levels:
1. File structure (container)
2. Presentation envelope (metadata)
3. Pure semantic content (meaning)

By separating these levels, we achieve superior compression and content-based deduplication.

Conclusion
PaniniFS represents a paradigm shift in how we think about file storage.
The future of filesystems is semantic, not just structural.
