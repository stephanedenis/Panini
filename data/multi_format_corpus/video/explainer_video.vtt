00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Container versus content separation explained

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.000
Every file has a container and content

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.000
The container is format-specific structure

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.000
The content is the semantic meaning

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.000
Separating these enables better optimization
