Welcome to the PaniniFS video tutorial

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:07,000
In this video we'll learn about multi-format analysis

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,000
The same content can exist in many formats

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:15,000
Text files, PDFs, EPUBs all contain the same information

5
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:19,000
PaniniFS extracts the invariant semantic content

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,000
This enables cross-format deduplication and compression
