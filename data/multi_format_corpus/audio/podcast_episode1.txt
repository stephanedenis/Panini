Welcome to PaniniFS podcast.

In this episode, we explore how semantic filesystems work.
Traditional filesystems only understand bytes and blocks.
But what if your filesystem understood meaning?

That's where PaniniFS comes in.
By analyzing content at multiple levels, we can achieve compression ratios that seem impossible.

The key insight is separating the container from the content.
The container is how data is stored.
The content is what the data means.

Join us next time as we dive deeper into dhatu theory.
