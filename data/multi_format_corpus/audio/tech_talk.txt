PaniniFS Technical Deep Dive

This talk covers the architecture of PaniniFS.
We'll examine the three-level separation model.

Level one is the filesystem container.
This includes inodes, blocks, and filesystem metadata.

Level two is the presentation envelope.
For a PDF, this is the PDF structure.
For an EPUB, this is the ZIP container and metadata.

Level three is pure semantic content.
This is the meaning, independent of format.
A book has the same semantic content whether it's PDF, EPUB, or plain text.

By optimizing each level independently, we achieve superior results.
